# Terrain Generator
## Overview
Generates random terrain using various height algorithms (circle algorithm, fault algorithm, and particle deposition). Also features OpenGL lighting, viewing of the terrain in different modes (wireframe and solid view), and camera movement.

## How to Run
Prior to running the program, OpenGL must be installed. Simply run `make` from the command line within the same folder that contains the project files.
